## Research Interests

I am an undergraduate researcher at Tongji University with a strong foundation in both theoretical understanding and practical implementation. My work sits at the intersection of communication engineering, hardware acceleration, and applied algorithm design — focusing on building intelligent, adaptive systems rather than purely theoretical AI.

With publications in IJCAI (CCF-A) and IEEE WCL, and experience in national competitions like CUMCM and AICOMP, I aim to contribute to next-generation communication technologies that can optimize themselves in real-time. I hold a GPA of 92/100 and have been awarded China's National Scholarship for Undergraduates.
